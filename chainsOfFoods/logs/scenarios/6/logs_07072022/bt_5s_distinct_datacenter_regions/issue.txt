It was discovered that with nodes in very distant locations in this experiment didn't become in sync even if all nodes continuing execution. After sending transactions into the network 3 nodes succeeded to included them and receive the block contained by them, however n1 was not in sync with the other 3 nodes as initial, and a network partition happened, also the finalized height was different from the 3 nodes and the blockchain stopped to finalize blocks. Furthermore, as Lisk-BFT rules n1 has 39 delegate accounts from 103, this is more than 1/3 accounts, and because of that the blocks added by n2, n3, n4 should not be valid for the entire network.
