It was discovered that with nodes in very distant locations in this experiment they can become not in sync even if all nodes are in execution. After sending transactions into the network 3 nodes succeeded to included them and receive the block contained by them, however n1 was not in sync with the 3 nodes as before, and also the finalized height was different from the 3 nodes. Furthermore, as Lisk-BFT rules n1 has 39 delegate accounts from 103, this is more than 1/3 accounts, and because of that the blocks added by n2, n3, n4 should not be valid for the entire network.
